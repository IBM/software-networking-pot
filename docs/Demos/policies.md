# zSystems - Mainframe Demo

## Demo Overview

This demo shows how SevOne NPM can monitor all the network including mainframe systems, allowing us to have a complete view of the network and easily troubleshoot any problem with the performance of the Z systems.



## Story
 
There are some intermittent problems with the performance of some of the applications running on a Z system, however the operations team cannot find why.

SevOne with its anomaly detection engine, its ability to monitor all the network and to visually correlate metrics from different sources together will help find where the issue is and how to fix it.
