# Hybrid Cloud Demo

## Demo Overview
This demo shows how SevOne NPM can monitor any network, either on prem, private cloud or public cloud, giving you a single pane of glass with all the information you need from your network.

## Story

CloudOps needs to run constant reports with the status of the cloud networks as well as other cloud entities such as instances, workloads, etc… It takes too long for them to run separate reports from the different cloud management platforms to extract the data they need and collate it into a single report.

NetOps are having problems getting access to that data, and this is impacting on their ability to troubleshooting network problems. Also, there are problems on Gateways from different providers, however when they review individually the metrics on each of the cloud management platforms, they can’t find where the problem is.
