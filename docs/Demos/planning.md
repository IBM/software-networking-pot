# Network Automation - QoS Issue Detection and Resolution with SevOne Automated Network Observability

## Demo Overview
This demo shows how we can use SevOne Automated Network Observability to detect misconfigurations on the network and automate configuration changes with no scripting knowledge.

## Story

Configuring QoS perfectly at the first chance is almost impossible, as there will be always some tweaking required. However, in complex networks with thousands of interfaces and QoS configurations, detecting where QoS could be optimize is very difficult task.

With SevOneâ€™s ability to analyze all the capture data and understand normal behaviour, detecting QoS misconfigurations is easy. And with IBM Rapid Network Automation we will able to reconfigure all the misconfigurations automatically in a consistent way and democratize the access to network automation.
