# Executive Reporting Demo

This demos shows how we can create executive/managerial reports in SevOne in a way that the audience can easily understand the status of the network and can control and maintain the SLAs.

## Story
A network manager wants to review the current status of the network because there were some problems yesterday with one of the internal services and wants to make sure there is no problem now.

On top of this, the network manager wants to review if there is any SLA being breached in any of their offices, just to make sure everything in the network is running smoothly.

## Value
This demo shows our ability to abstract the complexity of technical reports and show the status of the network in an easy way to understand. Also, we provide with the high level information that managers need to have enough visibility of the status of the network, if there is any issue and if there are any SLAs being breached.
