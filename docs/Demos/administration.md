# 5G Telco Network Demo

## Demo Overview 

This demo shows how SevOne can monitor data from any telco domain, and correlate these data from different domains into a single dashboard, providing and end to end visibility of the telco network in a single pane of glass. 



## Story

This telco company is struggling to pinpoint where the issue is on the network. There has been detected some problems on the 5G telco cloud but the team that works on the core network cannot understand why this is happening. Something similar happens in the RAN domain, where they are spending thousands of man hours trying to fix a problem they donâ€™t know where it is. Now this telco company has installed SevOne to monitor the whole 5G network and is able to pinpoint where the issue is in.
