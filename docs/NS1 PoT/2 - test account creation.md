# Test Account Creation
## Overview
Creating an NS1 account for customer testing is easy and quick.

A customer can turn a testing account into a production account, so no data is lost, if they want to buy it.

[Account Signup Page](https://my.nsone.net/#/account/signup)

1. Fill in customer details at signup form above. 
Note: If the customer receives a message their account is waiting to be reviewed, you can email the NS1 Project Office with their customer name to expedite this process and re-apply at the signup page.

2. To raise limits beyond the developer account limits, email NS1.Project.Office@ibm.com, with your desired limits.
The recommended limits look like below. Feel free to copy and paste this into your email.

**3000 Records**

**50M Queries**

**25 Filter Chains**

**25 Monitors**

**Enable Pulsar**

**Enable DNS Insights**

**Enable HTTPS Redirect**

**Enable China Network** (if testing)

3. The customer can start using the platform straight away but may need a few hours to enable the features listed above. Note: If a customer is looking to test Dedicated DNS, please Slack in the #ns1-project-office to find out options available.
