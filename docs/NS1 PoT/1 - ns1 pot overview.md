# NS1 POT Overview & Framework
## Introduction
IBM NS1 Connect is a managed service for authoritative DNS and traffic steering that improves application performance and network resilience. Revenue-generating applications require authoritative DNS resolution to keep critical applications and websites online. Unless the DNS infrastructure is always-on and resilient, network reliability and user experience will suffer.

IBM NS1 Connect provides fast, secure connections to users anywhere in the world with premium/enterprise-grade DNS and advanced, customizable traffic steering. NS1 Connect’s always-on, API-first architecture enables IT teams to more efficiently monitor networks, deploy changes and conduct routine maintenance.

To further optimize DNS performance, IBM NS1 Connect offers rich DNS data analytics to streamline the identification of the root cause of anomalies within traffic.

The main benefits of this platform are:
- **Improve reliability and resilience** – Keep users reliably connected and revenue flowing with a 100% uptime SLA, constant monitoring and redundant protections against service deprecation.

- **Optimize network performance** – Advanced, customizable traffic steering capabilities ensure you can deliver applications, services and content with the performance customer's users expect. 

- **Streamline DNS management** – Spend more time on higher-value work by automating both simple and complex DNS configuration tasks through NS1 Connect’s API and preconfigured integrations.


Purpose
The purpose of this PoT is to review and learn some of the main functionality available in the platform, such as DNS Administration, Automatic Failover, Geographic Steering, API Integrations (including SANO), and NS1 as a Redundant Secondary DNS provider. At the end of this PoT, the user should be able to understand, explain and demonstrate the main features to the customer.
This PoT does not cover all the features and functionalities but should give you an idea of what features/functionalities to demo and test with a customer.



## POT Framework Document
The framework described in this document linked below covers various use cases which cover common sets of technical requirements. It then goes on to define success criteria for each of these use cases and a description of the steps required to validate them. Not all of these use cases will be relevant to you, so part of the process will be to work with the customer to identify which use cases are relevant. You have a number of the POTs to follow to test this process with a customer.

Please make a duplicate copy and share with the customer testing as a living document, to make notes on from either side.
